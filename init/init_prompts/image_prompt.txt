This prompt is for generating one single image that complements a short daily story.  
The image must follow the mood and simplicity appropriate for children.

1. Structure of the prompt:
   - (1) Define the time of day and weather: “a sunny afternoon”, “a cloudy morning”
   - (2) Set a recognizable location: “a playground”, “a classroom”, “a quiet forest”
   - (3) Add 1–2 main visual elements (subject + action): “a child hugging a cat”, “a rabbit sitting under a tree”
   - (4) Optional background activity or atmosphere: “soft sunlight through leaves”, “toys scattered in the background”

2. Style guidelines:
   - Language must be simple, clear, and visual-first.
   - Avoid complex emotions or metaphorical phrases.
   - Use gentle adjectives: soft, warm, peaceful, friendly, bright.
   - Avoid: dark, scary, surreal, chaotic, hyper-realistic.

3. Framing:
   - The image should feel like a snapshot from the story – a single moment in time.
   - Focus on 1 main scene or emotion, not multiple story beats.
   - Keep the scene open and friendly for interpretation by a child.

4. Format recommendations:
   - Use commas to separate scene elements clearly.
   - Avoid chaining too many concepts in one prompt.
   - Avoid negations like “not scary” – instead, specify what *is* visible.
