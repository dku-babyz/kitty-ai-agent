Today, the blue cat Kitty spent a day with a new friend she met in the forest. Early in the morning, she returned to the forest where the sunlight warmly shone. Kitty found a small brown squirrel near the pond. The squirrel came down from the tree and approached Kitty. At first, Kitty was a bit startled, but the squirrel's bright eyes made her feel friendly. Together, they gathered leaves to build a small house. ‘Meeting a friend in the forest is truly special!’ Kitty thought to herself. Today's adventure ended with precious memories of a new friendship.
